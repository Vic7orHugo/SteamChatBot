# SteamChatBot

This is just a little project. I'm trying to implement a simple Steam Chat Bot using GUI Automation in Python 3. 
It is not fancy at all, but for a first project, I believe it's fine. 
If someone even come to see this and have some way to improve it, please let me know.
Also, feel free to take the code, I don't mind. Although, I don't think it has any use for you XD.

Thanks for helping me test this bot:
